# file-uploader

A file storage service built with EJS, Tailwind, Express.js, and Prisma ORM. The service allows users to create an account to securely manage their folders and files. Folders
can be easily shared with a custom time limit and viewed
by anyone with the generated link. Data is stored with PostgreSQL and linked to cloudinary for secure file access.
